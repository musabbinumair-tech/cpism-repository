    <h1> INTRODUCTION OF CSS</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="text" id="paragraph">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It allows developers to control layout, colors, fonts, and overall aesthetics of web pages. By separating content from design, CSS enhances the flexibility and maintainability of web development. Additionally, it supports responsive design, enabling websites to adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
