    <h1>ABOUT PAKISTAN</h1>
    <h4>Pakistan, located in South Asia, is a country with a rich and complex history, diverse culture, and a unique geopolitical significance. It was established on August 14, 1947, following the partition of British India, which resulted in the creation of two independent dominions, India and Pakistan. The partition was largely based on religious lines, with Pakistan intended as a homeland for Muslims, while India remained a secular state. This division led to massive migrations, communal violence, and long-lasting regional tensions. Geographically, Pakistan is strategically located, sharing borders with India, Afghanistan, Iran, and China, and having a coastline along the Arabian Sea.</h4>
